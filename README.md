# Lucibox

This is about music, machines and D.I.Y
**Lucibox** is more than an a software, it's a concept that allow people to create their own musical machine

This project is created from **Un Des Sens**
[ http://AssoUnDesSens.fr/lucibox
](http://assoundessens.fr/lucibox)

It's a french project, so the website is only in french right now, but the code approach is in english, and the "github" approach too.

# Concept

At the contrary of a workstation, Lucibox is not only a musical software to play sitted in front of your desktop. It is a software to create musical machine, play live,  indeed headless and controlled from interface.

 1. Try the software on your computer
 2. Control it with an arduino, keyboard, or midi controler
 3. Switch from computer to Raspberry Pi
 4. Build the enclosure
 5.  You have now a musical machine

## Education

The first goal about this project is a musical approch about arduino, raspberry pi, and D.I.Y stuff.  The first folder, called "exemple", means that their exemples inside are used during arduino workshop, in order to discover both the origines of electronic music and D.I.Y culture.

## Personalized musical machine
The second goal of this software is to personalize machine, for musician , that have specials need and special esthetics.


# Software

Software is based on [PureData](https://puredata.info)  ( or Pd ) 
Externals are included, just download PureData, and Lucibox.
Puredata work on all platform, that's make the code really easy to move from desktop to Raspberry Pi.

# Controler

The software can be controlled from Arduino ( serial ), midi controller, or keyboard ( including Makey Makey board ).  All arduino sketches and shematics are free to use.

# What are the folder?
## Exemple

Contains exemples of how the software can be used. For each exemple, you can control it using only the computer mouse, or a controller if you want. 

## Machines

A machine is the result of a headless raspberry pi, containing the lucibox program and working as an hardware audio material. It can be an effect pedal , a sampler , and loopstation. More than the software, there is the entire documentation of the components and the materials you need.
There is also a link to the raspberry pi image, that's make the machine easy to build, for any people far or close from the D.I.Y stuff.

## Patches 

Contains all the PureData Patches that the program needs. They are documented in a specific doc file, in the documentation folder.

## Samples

Contains samples of "one shot" sound and drum loops. These samples are shared samples. The samples from loopstation saving its sessions are located in the folder of the exemple or the machine using the looper.

## Docs

This is the generic documentation platform of the project
