# Lucibox

This is about music, machines and D.I.Y
**Lucibox** is more than an a software, it's a concept about allowing people to create their own musical machine

This project is created from **Un Des Sens**
[ http://AssoUnDesSens.fr/lucibox
](http://assoundessens.fr/lucibox)

It's a french project, so the website is only in french right now, but the code approach is in english, and the "github" approach too.

# Concept

At the contrary of a workstation, Lucibox is not a musical software to play sitted in front of your desktop. It is a software to create musical machine, play live,  indeed headless and control from interface.

 1. Try the software on your computer
 2. Control it with an arduino, keyboard, or midi controler
 3. Switch from computer to Raspberry Pi
 4. Build the enclosure
 5.  You have now a musical machine

# Education

The first goal about this project is a musical approch about arduino, raspberry pi, and D.I.Y stuff.  The first folder, called "atelier", or workshop, means that their exemples inside are used during arduino workshop, in order to discover both the origines of electronic music and D.I.Y culture.

# Personalized musical machine
The second goal of this software is to personalize machine, for musician , that have specials need and special esthetics.


# Software

Software is based on [PureData](https://puredata.info)  ( or Pd ) 
Externals are included, just download PureData, and Lucibox.
Puredata work on all platform, that's make the code really easy to move from desktop to Raspberry Pi.

# Controler

The software can be controlled from Arduino ( serial ), midi controller, or keyboard.  All arduino sketches and shematics are free to use
